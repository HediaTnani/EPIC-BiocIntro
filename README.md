Introduction to Bioconductor

## Course Description

The Bioconductor project provides open-source software based on the R programming language for statistical analysis and visualization of high-throughput genomic data. This course provides a broad introduction to the project, from navigating its large collection of packages to its core functionality for representation, manipulation, and visualization of genomic data. We will learn how to efficiently analyze genomic intervals and SNPs, how to manage experiments of one or more genomic data type with clinical and pathological data, and how to visualize genomic data. This workshop equips participants with essential background for a wide range of applications in statistical genomics and genetic epidemiology, such as GWAS, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, metagenomics, and multi'omic experiments.


## Course Objectives

Part 1: Intro to RNA-seq data

    Understand biological and technical features of RNA-seq data
    Identify methods to map and count reads
    Understand the quantitative measures used in RNA-seq analysis
    Import data into Bioconductor

 

Part 2: Pre-processing

    Carry out exploratory data analysis on read level and gene level
    Identify normalization strategies to adjust for gene-level effects (eg. gene length or GC content)
    Identify normalization strategies to adjust for sample-level effects (eg. sequencing depth)

 

Part 3: Differential expression analysis

    Describe how RNA-seq data are modeled with generalized linear models
    Describe the concepts involved in differential expression analysis with edgeR and DESeq2
    Identify similarities and differences between edgeR and DESeq2
    Carry out a differential expression analysis on real data

 

Part 4: Gene set enrichment analysis

    Describe gene set analysis theory and terminology
    Describe how GO and KEGG define gene sets
    Describe statistical concepts underlying overrepresentation analysis
    Describe functional class scoring & permutation testing
    Carry out gene set enrichment analysis on real data


## Prerequisites

This workshop is accessible for those with little or no experience using Bioconductor, although even more experienced users can benefit from the broad overview of Bioconductor paradigms. The workshop assumes elementary knowledge of R, which can be gained in advance or simultaneously from other courses such as the introductory course from DataCamp. A basic understanding of genome biology and statistical analysis is helpful, but specific prerequisites are not needed.
